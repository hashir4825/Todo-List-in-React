Painting allows me to express my thoughts and emotions in a visual form and provides me with a sense of accomplishment when I complete a piece.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  As a web and app developer, I also enjoy exploring the latest trends and technologies in the field of technology. I often spend time reading tech blogs, watching tutorial videos, and experimenting with new tools and frameworks. This hobby not only helps me stay updated with the latest developments but also enhances my skills and expertise in my profession.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default About;\r\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAOC,KAAK,MAAM,UAAU;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAAA,SAAAC,QAAA,IAAAC,SAAA;AAE7B,MAAMC,KAAK,GAAGA,CAAA,KAAM;EAChB,MAAMC,KAAK,GAAG;IACVC,KAAK,EAAE;MACLC,SAAS,EAAE;IACb;EACF,CAAC;EACL,oBACEN,OAAA,CAAAE,SAAA;IAAAK,QAAA,gBACEP,OAAA;MAAKQ,SAAS,EAAC,4BAA4B;MAAAD,QAAA,eACzCP,OAAA;QAAKQ,SAAS,EAAC,KAAK;QAAAD,QAAA,gBAClBP,OAAA;UAAKQ,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;UAAAD,QAAA,eACvBP,OAAA;YACES,GAAG,EAAEX,KAAM;YACXY,GAAG,EAAC,SAAS;YACbF,SAAS,EAAC;UAA0B;YAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACrC;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACC,CAAC,eACNd,OAAA;UAAKQ,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;UAAAD,QAAA,gBACvBP,OAAA;YAAAO,QAAA,EAAI;UAAQ;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACjBd,OAAA;YAAAO,QAAA,EAAG;UAMH;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJd,OAAA;YAAAO,QAAA,EAAG;UAMH;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJd,OAAA;YAAAO,QAAA,EAAG;UAKH;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACD,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACH;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACH,CAAC,eACNd,OAAA;MAAKQ,SAAS,EAAC,4BAA4B;MAAAD,QAAA,eACzCP,OAAA;QAAKQ,SAAS,EAAC,KAAK;QAAAD,QAAA,gBAClBP,OAAA;UAAKQ,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;UAAAD,QAAA,eACvBP,OAAA;YAAKI,KAAK,EAAEA,KAAK,CAACC,KAAM;YACtBI,GAAG,EAAC,yLAAyL;YAC7LC,GAAG,EAAC,iCAAiC;YACrCF,SAAS,EAAC;UAAW;YAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACtB;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACC,CAAC,eACNd,OAAA;UAAKQ,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;UAAAD,QAAA,gBACvBP,OAAA;YAAAO,QAAA,EAAI;UAAuB;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAChCd,OAAA;YAAAO,QAAA,GAAG,gbAQD,eAAAP,OAAA;cAAAO,QAAA,EAAG;YAMH;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJd,OAAA;cAAAO,QAAA,EAAG;YAMH;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG,CAAC;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACH,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACD,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACH;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACH,CAAC,eACNd,OAAA;MAAKQ,SAAS,EAAC,4BAA4B;MAAAD,QAAA,eACzCP,OAAA;QAAKQ,SAAS,EAAC,KAAK;QAAAD,QAAA,gBAClBP,OAAA;UAAKQ,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;UAAAD,QAAA,eACzBP,OAAA;YAAKI,KAAK,EAAEA,KAAK,CAACC,KAAM;YAACI,GAAG,EAAC,2KAA2K;YAACC,GAAG,EAAC,yBAAyB;YAACF,SAAS,EAAC;UAAW;YAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAE;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAC1P,CAAC,eACNd,OAAA;UAAKQ,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;UAAAD,QAAA,gBACvBP,OAAA;YAAAO,QAAA,EAAI;UAAO;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAChBd,OAAA;YAAAO,QAAA,EAAG;UAEf;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJd,OAAA;YAAAO,QAAA,EAAG;UAEH;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJd,OAAA;YAAAO,QAAA,EAAG;UAEH;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAEW,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACH;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACH,CAAC;EAAA,eACN,CAAC;AAEP,CAAC;AAACC,EAAA,GArGIZ,KAAK;AAuGX,eAAeA,KAAK;AAAC,IAAAY,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
